# odin-recipes
Project 1 using the Odin Project

This is my first attempt at setting up a README

This is also my first project following the instructions of The Odin Project

## DESCRIPTION
**RECIPES:** This early project is to garner practice on setting up a roughly made recipe website without CSS. 
The skills I have learned so far prior to the creation of this project is borderplates, lists, insering headers, texts, images and links.
